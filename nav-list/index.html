            <h1>National Parliament</h1>
            Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban or National Parliament Building, (Bengali: জাতীয় সংসদ ভবন Jatiyô Sôngsôd Bhôbôn) is the house of the Parliament of Bangladesh, located at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka.
             Designed while the country was still part of Pakistan by architect Louis Kahn, the complex is one of the largest legislative complexes in the world, covering 200 acres (810,000 m2).[1]
The building was featured prominently in the 2003 film My Architect, detailing the career and familial legacy of its architect, Louis Kahn. Robert McCarter, author of Louis I. Kahn, described the National Parliament of Bangladesh as one of the twentieth century's most significant buildings.[2]

            <p>
                The Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh and the first Parliament held their sittings in the building that now houses the Prime Minister's Office
                 and which is often referred as the old Shangshad Bhaban (old Parliament House).  The second Parliament also held most of its sittings in that building, the last sitting being on 10 July 1981. It was during the tenure of the second Parliament that the present Parliament building, or Shangshad Bhaban, located at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar,
                 became functional. Its eighth, and incidentally the last session, commenced on 15 February 1982 in the new building.

                The design of the Parliament Building, made by the famous architect Professor
                Louis I. Kahn, was evolved from the basic human requirement of protection from the glare and fury of nature.
                This has been achieved through the overall arrangement of the complex in different groups of buildings in which normal external lines
                are deeply recessed by porticoes with huge geometric openings on its outer facade, forming the visual characteristics of the building.
